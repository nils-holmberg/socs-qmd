Eco-tourism is a relatively new way for Sweden’s native population to make a living. Guided tours of northern lights and rides in reindeer sleds are examples of popular activities. Besides reindeer herding and meat production, arts and handicrafts is another traditional trade that has survived into modern days. Most Sami, however, have jobs with no connection to the traditional way of life. The tents they once lived in can still be seen in the north of Sweden. Today they are solely used for cultural purposes.
