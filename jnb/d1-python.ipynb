        "\n",
        "The Python interpreter is a tool that allows for the execution of Python code directly. To install, one typically downloads the appropriate version from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follows the installation instructions. Once installed, the interpreter can be launched by typing `python` in the command line or terminal. To open a file on disk, use `file = open('filename.txt', 'r')`. To run a simple script, save the code to a `.py` file, like `script.py`, and execute it with `python script.py` from the command line. From the Python prompt, scripts can be run using `exec(open('script.py').read())`. Working with python in this environment can be improved with a good cross-platform code editor, e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).\n",

        "\n",
        "[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) is a distribution that simplifies Python and R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. It bundles a suite of tools, including an IDE called Spyder. To use Python in Spyder, one installs Anaconda3, launches Spyder, and begins coding in its interactive editor. Spyder offers features like variable exploration, integrated IPython console, and a multi-language editor. Compared to a standalone Python interpreter, which offers a basic environment for script execution, Spyder provides a more comprehensive development experience with debugging tools, code completion, and an integrated documentation viewer, streamlining the coding and analysis process. NB! If you are on a LU work computer, you should consult with IT support () to istall from Software center.\n",

        "Jupyter Notebooks offer an interactive environment to write and execute Python code. Accessible via a web browser, users can combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document. To use Python in Jupyter, one installs Jupyter via `pip` or `conda`, then launches it, creating or opening notebooks. Each notebook cell can be executed independently, allowing iterative development. Compared to a Python interpreter, Jupyter provides a more visual and structured approach. While Python IDEs offer robust development tools and debugging capabilities, Jupyter excels in data exploration, analysis, and presenting results, making it a favorite among data scientists and researchers. Try jupyter notebooks on [Anaconda cloud](https://nb.anaconda.cloud). \n",

        "[Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a cloud-based platform that allows users to write and execute Python code in a web-based environment. To use Python in Google Colab, one simply navigates to the Colab website, starts a new notebook, and begins coding. The platform provides free access to GPUs, making it suitable for machine learning tasks. Unlike local Python installations, there's no setup required, and notebooks are easily shareable. However, while Colab offers the convenience of working in the cloud, using Python locally provides more control over the environment, dependencies, and data storage. In contrast, Colab sessions are ephemeral, and prolonged inactivity can lead to disconnection.\n",

        "4. **Lists**: Ordered collections, e.g., [1, 2, \"a\"].\n",
        "5. **Tuples**: Immutable ordered collections, e.g., (1, 2, \"b\").\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **If Statement**: Tests a condition and executes a block of code if true.\n",
        "2. **Elif and Else**: Supplements the `if` statement, allowing for multiple conditions or a default action.\n",
